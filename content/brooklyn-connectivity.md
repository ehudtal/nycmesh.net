title: "Brooklyn Connectivity Update 10/17"
---

We've upgraded the connection from 1340 today. 
It might still be a bit slow but we're working on improving its speed further in coming days.
Please sign into the [#1340-alerts](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/CBK1FR63A/) channel on slack to receive updates.

As always, if you are experiencing issues with your connection, you can:
  - Create a [support ticket](/support) or 
  - Contact us on [the #support channel on slack](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/C679UKBUK). 

_Context: Our Supernode 2 had to be taken down for roof repair which forced us to make major changes to the area's network. 
The good news is many new hub nodes are coming online, so there will be more choices to connect to in the coming weeks._

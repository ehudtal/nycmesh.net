title: "Brooklyn Connectivity Update 10/17"
---

We've upgraded the connection from 1340 today, and will work on improving its speed further. 

If you are in Brooklyn and experiencing issues with your connection at this point:
  - Look for updates on the [#1340-alerts](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/CBK1FR63A/) channel on slack
  - Look for updates here
  - Create a [support ticket](/support) or contact us on [the #support channel on slack](https://nycmesh.slack.com/messages/C679UKBUK). 

Context: Our Supernode 2 had to be taken down for roof repair which forced us to make major changes to the area's network. 
The good news is many new hub nodes are coming online, so there will be more choices to connect to in the coming weeks.
